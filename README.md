#### sell-through(noun) == SeLL TruE

*"the ratio of the quantity of goods sold by a retailer to the quantity originally delivered to it wholesale"*

### User Stories
SeLL TruE is created with the basis to help a group of retailers to have better visibility and control over their products that they consign with anchor merchants. Unfortnately most of the time they do not have access to real-time sales information.
With SeLL TruE we are able to assist them with real time information and analytics for the retailers to have better product planning and go-to-market strategies!
